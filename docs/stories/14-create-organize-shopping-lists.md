# User Story: 14 - Create and Organize Shopping Lists

**As a** shopper,
**I want** to create multiple organized shopping lists that integrate with my monitored products and price alerts,
**so that** I can efficiently plan and execute my purchases when optimal conditions are met.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can create multiple named shopping lists for different purposes (personal, gifts, office, seasonal)
* I can add products to lists directly from monitored products or by manual entry
* Lists automatically show current prices and indicate recent price changes
* I can organize list items by category, priority, or custom sorting
* I can set budgets for individual lists and track spending against them
* I can share lists with family members or colleagues with appropriate permissions
* I can convert monitoring alerts directly into list items
* I can mark items as purchased and track purchase history per list

## Notes

* This enhances the existing Story 5 with more detailed list management features
* Should integrate tightly with monitoring and alert systems
* Consider collaborative features for shared household purchases
* Budget tracking helps users stay within spending limits
* Purchase history can inform future shopping decisions and seasonal patterns
