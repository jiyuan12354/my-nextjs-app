# User Story: 1 - Monitor Product Prices

**As an** office worker,
**I want** to set up monitoring for products I'm interested in,
**so that** I can be notified when prices drop without having to manually check multiple platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can add products to my monitoring list from different shopping platforms
* I can set price thresholds or percentage drop alerts for each product
* The system automatically checks prices across multiple platforms
* I receive notifications when my monitored products meet my price criteria
* I can view the current status and price history of all monitored products

## Notes

* This addresses the core pain point mentioned: office workers don't have time to search and compare prices manually
* The system should aggregate data from multiple shopping platforms
* Price updates should be frequent enough to catch good deals but not overwhelm users
