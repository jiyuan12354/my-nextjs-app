# User Story: 2 - Generate Shopping Plans

**As an** office worker,
**I want** the system to automatically generate shopping plans from my price alerts,
**so that** I can efficiently purchase multiple items when they reach good prices.

## Acceptance Criteria

* When multiple monitored products trigger price alerts, they are grouped into a shopping plan
* Shopping plans show estimated total savings compared to regular prices
* I can review and modify shopping plans before executing purchases
* Plans include direct links to purchase each item from the best-priced platform
* I can schedule shopping plans for specific times or set reminders

## Notes

* This aggregates the low-price alerts into actionable shopping lists
* Helps users make bulk purchasing decisions efficiently
* Should consider shipping costs and delivery timing in plan optimization
