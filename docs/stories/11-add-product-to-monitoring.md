# User Story: 11 - Add Product to Monitoring

**As a** shopper,
**I want** to easily add a new product to my monitoring list with customizable alert settings,
**so that** I can start tracking its price and receive notifications when it meets my criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can add a product by entering its URL from supported shopping platforms
* I can manually enter product details (name, target price, preferred retailers)
* I can set specific price thresholds (target price, percentage drop, or both)
* I can choose notification preferences for this specific product
* The system validates the product information and confirms successful addition
* I can preview the product details before confirming the addition
* I receive immediate feedback on whether the product was successfully added

## Notes

* This covers the "Add Product" quick action from the dashboard
* Should support major shopping platforms (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, etc.)
* Product validation should include checking if the URL is accessible and extracting basic product info
* Consider allowing bulk import or wishlist integration for power users
