# User Story: 07 - User Authentication and Login

**As a** office worker user,
**I want** to log in to the shopping platform with my credentials,
**so that** I can access my personalized monitoring lists, price alerts, and shopping plans securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Users can log in using email and password
* Login form validates user credentials
* Successful login redirects to the user's dashboard (`/dashboard`)
* Failed login shows appropriate error messages
* Users remain logged in across browser sessions (remember me option)
* Logout functionality is available in the header
* User session is maintained securely
* Login page is responsive and works on mobile devices
* Already authenticated users accessing `/auth/login` are redirected to dashboard
* Deep linking support: users can access protected pages and be redirected after login

## Login Flow

### Successful Login Process
1. User enters valid credentials on login form
2. System validates credentials against mock user database
3. Session is created and stored in localStorage
4. User is automatically redirected to dashboard (`/dashboard`)
5. Dashboard displays personalized welcome message and user stats

### Navigation Rules
- **Unauthenticated users** accessing protected routes → redirected to `/auth/login`
- **Successful login** → redirect to `/dashboard` (or originally requested page)
- **Already authenticated users** accessing `/auth/login` → redirect to `/dashboard`
- **Logout** → redirect to `/auth/login` with session cleared
- **Session expiry** → show notification and redirect to `/auth/login`

## Known Issues & Debugging

### Current Issue: Login Redirect Failure ⚠️
**Status**: [!] Blocked - requires debugging
**Description**: Login authentication succeeds but redirect to dashboard fails

**Symptoms**:
- Console shows "✅ Login successful, redirecting to: /dashboard"
- `router.push('/dashboard')` is called but navigation doesn't occur
- User remains on login page despite successful authentication
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Issue persists even after clearing localStorage/sessionStorage

**Technical Context**:
- AuthProvider correctly updates authentication state
- Login form correctly calls `router.push(redirectTo)`
- No infinite loops (previously resolved)
- RouteGuard components working correctly
- Session management functioning properly

**Debugging Steps Needed**:
1. Check if router.push() returns a Promise and handle it properly
2. Verify Next.js routing configuration
3. Test different redirect methods (router.replace, window.location)
4. Check for any middleware or route blocking
5. Verify dashboard route is properly configured
6. Add comprehensive logging to track router state changes

**Implementation Task**: Fix login redirect mechanism to ensure successful authentication properly navigates to dashboard

## Notes

* **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Use mock authentication for development and testing
  - Hard-coded user credentials for demo purposes
  - Local storage for session management
  - Basic login/logout flow without backend integration
* **Phase 2 (Future)**: Implement real user registration and authentication
  - User registration with email verification
  - Password reset functionality
  - Integration with backend authentication service
  - Secure session management with JWT tokens
* This story enables personalized features like saving monitoring lists and receiving notifications
* Authentication is a prerequisite for most other user stories in the platform
