# User Story: 07 - User Authentication and Login

**As a** office worker user,
**I want** to log in to the shopping platform with my credentials,
**so that** I can access my personalized monitoring lists, price alerts, and shopping plans securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Users can log in using email and password
* Login form validates user credentials
* Successful login redirects to the user's dashboard
* Failed login shows appropriate error messages
* Users remain logged in across browser sessions (remember me option)
* Logout functionality is available in the header
* User session is maintained securely
* Login page is responsive and works on mobile devices

## Notes

* **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Use mock authentication for development and testing
  - Hard-coded user credentials for demo purposes
  - Local storage for session management
  - Basic login/logout flow without backend integration
* **Phase 2 (Future)**: Implement real user registration and authentication
  - User registration with email verification
  - Password reset functionality
  - Integration with backend authentication service
  - Secure session management with JWT tokens
* This story enables personalized features like saving monitoring lists and receiving notifications
* Authentication is a prerequisite for most other user stories in the platform
