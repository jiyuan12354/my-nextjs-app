# User Story: 13 - Manage Price Alerts and Notifications

**As a** shopper,
**I want** to comprehensively manage all my price alerts and notification settings,
**so that** I can customize how and when I receive notifications to match my preferences and schedule.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can view all active price alerts with their current status and trigger conditions
* I can create custom alert rules beyond simple price drops (e.g., back in stock, new deals, competitor price matching)
* I can set global notification preferences (email, browser push, SMS, quiet hours)
* I can configure different notification settings for different types of alerts
* I can view alert history including triggered alerts and actions taken
* I can temporarily disable all alerts or specific categories
* I can set up recurring alerts (daily summaries, weekly reports)
* I can test notification settings to ensure they work correctly

## Notes

* This covers the "Price Alerts" quick action from the dashboard
* Should allow granular control over notification timing and frequency
* Consider smart notification grouping to avoid overwhelming users
* Integration with calendar apps could help optimize notification timing
* Alert templates for common scenarios (holiday shopping, back-to-school, etc.)
