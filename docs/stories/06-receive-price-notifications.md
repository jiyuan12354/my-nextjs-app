# User Story: 6 - Receive Price Notifications

**As an** office worker,
**I want** to receive timely notifications when monitored products reach my target prices,
**so that** I can quickly take advantage of good deals without constantly checking the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can choose notification preferences (email, browser notifications, SMS if available)
* Notifications include product details, current price, and direct purchase links
* I can set quiet hours to avoid notifications during work or sleep times
* Notifications show the percentage discount or amount saved compared to regular price
* I can quickly snooze or dismiss notifications and adjust monitoring settings

## Notes

* Critical for busy office workers who can't actively monitor prices
* Should respect user preferences and not be overwhelming
* Consider different urgency levels for different types of price drops
* Integration with calendar systems could help optimize notification timing
