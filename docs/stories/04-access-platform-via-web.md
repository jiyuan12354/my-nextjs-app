# User Story: 4 - Access Platform via Web Interface

**As an** office worker,
**I want** to access the shopping platform through a web browser or mini-program,
**so that** I can use the service without downloading and installing a dedicated app.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The platform is accessible through a responsive web interface
* All core functionality works on both desktop and mobile browsers
* The interface loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience
* I can bookmark and easily return to the platform
* The web interface supports notifications for price alerts (when browser permits)

## Notes

* The discussion specifically mentioned preferring web/mini-program over a dedicated app
* Users are unlikely to download a specific app for price comparison
* Should be optimized for quick access during work breaks
* Consider progressive web app (PWA) features for better mobile experience
