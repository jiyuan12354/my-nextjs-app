# User Story: 08 - User Registration

**As a** new office worker,
**I want** to create an account on the shopping platform,
**so that** I can start monitoring product prices and building personalized shopping lists.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Users can register with email, password, and basic profile information
* Email validation is performed before account creation
* Password strength requirements are enforced
* Users receive a confirmation email after successful registration
* Registration form provides clear error messages for invalid inputs
* Users are automatically logged in after successful registration
* Registration page is responsive and works on mobile devices
* Terms of service and privacy policy acceptance is required

## Notes

* **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Registration functionality is not required - use mock login only
* **Phase 2 (Future Implementation)**: Full registration system
  - Email verification workflow
  - Profile management features
  - Integration with backend user management system
  - Password security best practices (hashing, salt)
* This story is a natural extension of the login functionality
* Registration enables user acquisition and personalized experience from the start
