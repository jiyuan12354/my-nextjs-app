# User Story: 3 - Compare Prices Across Platforms

**As an** office worker,
**I want** to see price comparisons for products across multiple shopping platforms,
**so that** I can quickly identify the best deals without visiting each platform individually.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I can search for products and see results from multiple shopping platforms
* Price comparison shows current prices, shipping costs, and total costs
* Results display platform reliability ratings or user reviews when available
* I can sort results by total price, shipping time, or platform preference
* The system shows price history and trends for each product across platforms

## Notes

* This provides the core aggregation functionality mentioned in the discussion
* Should integrate with popular shopping platforms through their APIs
* Price data needs to be updated frequently due to rapid changes in e-commerce pricing
